A Prometheus exporter for Linux system metrics that aggregates per-process resource usage into named process groups —
exposing stable, cardinality-safe time series at `/metrics` and full per-process forensic detail at `/html/details`.

---

## What it does

Herakles scrapes `/proc` on every request, classifies each running process into a `(group, subgroup)` pair using a
static lookup table, and exposes two fundamentally different views of that data:

- **`/metrics`** — Prometheus scrape endpoint. All process data is aggregated into `(group, subgroup)` pairs before
  encoding. No PID labels, no process name labels. Safe to scrape continuously at any interval.
- **`/html/details`** — Operator inspection endpoint. Full per-process breakdown with PIDs, USS, CPU%, I/O rates, and
  temporal anomaly classification. Intentionally not scraped by Prometheus.

The separation is architectural and deliberate. See [Why this architecture?](#why-this-architecture) for the reasoning.

## Why this architecture?

Most process-aware exporters expose per-PID label dimensions. This causes two well-understood problems: label
cardinality explodes as processes restart and accumulate new PIDs, and the resulting time series are too fine-grained
to be actionable in alert rules. An alert that fires on `process{pid="12345"}` is operationally useless — the PID
changes every restart and the label set varies across hosts.

Herakles solves this by classifying every running process into a named `(group, subgroup)` pair at scrape time.
`herakles_group_memory_rss_bytes{group="db",subgroup="postgres"}` means the same thing on every host and survives any
number of postgres restarts without stale series accumulation. This makes it safe to write recording rules and
multi-host federation queries over group metrics without cardinality concerns.

The human operator, however, needs the opposite: when an alert fires on `herakles_group_memory_rss_bytes`, they want
to know *which* postgres process is responsible. For this, `/html/details` intentionally exposes high-cardinality data
— PIDs, USS per process, CPU percentages — that would be unsafe in Prometheus but are perfectly appropriate for a
forensic endpoint read by humans or automation on demand, never scraped continuously.

**The cache model follows from the same reasoning.** `/metrics` serves data from an in-memory cache refreshed at most
every 5 seconds (`CACHE_UPDATE_THROTTLE_SECS`). A Prometheus scrape never blocks on `/proc` I/O: the scrape handler
reads from cache while a background tokio task asynchronously updates it. Staleness on the order of seconds is
irrelevant for a monitoring system.

---

## The Endpoints

Every capability in Herakles is exposed twice: once as plain text or Prometheus format for machines and automation,
and once as HTML for human operators. The split is intentional — the same underlying data, rendered appropriately for
each consumer.

### `/metrics` — Prometheus scrape target

Returns the full metric set in Prometheus text exposition format. No per-PID labels anywhere. All process-level data
has been aggregated into `(group, subgroup)` pairs before encoding. Scrape latency is bounded by lock acquisition
time, not `/proc` scan time.

This is the only endpoint Prometheus should scrape. When an alert fires — e.g.
`herakles_group_memory_rss_bytes{group="db",subgroup="postgres"} > 8e9` — open `/html/details?subgroup=postgres` on
the affected host to identify the responsible process.

### Process detail — `/details` and `/html/details`

Full per-process breakdown from the in-memory cache. Both variants accept a `?subgroup=<n>` query parameter to filter
to a specific subgroup. `/details` returns plain text suitable for `curl` and scripts; `/html/details` returns a
sortable, filterable HTML table for the browser.

Beyond a simple process list, both endpoints implement **temporal zone classification**: each process is assigned to
one of three phases based on age.

| Phase | Age | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Live | < 5 min | Recently started; no baseline established yet |
| Stabilization | 5–60 min | Settling; compared against short-term baseline |
| Historical | > 60 min | Stable; anomalies here are genuinely unexpected |

Within each phase, anomaly severity is computed from deviation against a rolling baseline stored in the ring buffer. A
postgres process in the Historical phase consuming 3× its normal RSS is flagged. A freshly started process consuming
the same amount is not.

**This is where you go after an alert fires.** `curl http://host:9215/details?subgroup=postgres` from a runbook, or
open `/html/details?subgroup=postgres` in a browser.

### Health — `/health` and `/html/health`

`/health` returns plain text with HTTP 200 if the cache is valid, 503 otherwise. Suitable for load balancer health
checks and monitoring probes.

`/html/health` renders the same data as HTML with additional detail: cache age, last update duration, buffer fill
levels for `/proc` I/O buffers (`smaps`, `smaps_rollup`, generic I/O), and eBPF subsystem status — whether eBPF
initialized successfully, events processed, and events dropped. This is the right place to look when diagnosing
unexpected metric gaps or eBPF initialization failures.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9215/health
# ok — cache age 3s, processes 347, ebpf ok
```

### Configuration — `/config` and `/html/config`

`/config` returns the effective merged configuration as plain text — the result of merging the config file with any
CLI overrides. Use this to verify that the right config file was loaded and that CLI flags took effect. Equivalent to
running `herakles-node-exporter --show-config` against the live process.

`/html/config` renders the same data as HTML with field descriptions inline.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9215/config
```

### Subgroups — `/subgroups` and `/html/subgroups`

`/subgroups` returns all loaded `(group, subgroup)` pairs with their process name patterns and command-line match
rules as plain text. Use this to verify that custom entries in `subgroups.toml` were parsed correctly, or to check
which pattern a specific process name would match.

`/html/subgroups` renders the same data as a searchable HTML table, useful for browsing the full 140+ entry
classification table.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9215/subgroups | grep postgres
# db  postgres  matches: [postgres, pg_dump, pg_restore, ...]
```

### Documentation — `/doc` and `/html/docs`

`/doc` returns a plain-text inline manual: all endpoints, all metrics, configuration fields, and example PromQL
queries. Intended as a self-contained reference accessible without network access to external documentation — a
manpage served over HTTP.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9215/doc | less
```

`/html/docs` and `/docs` render the same content as HTML with navigation.

### Landing page — `/` and `/html`

HTML landing page listing all available endpoints with links, exporter version, uptime, and current cache status. The
entry point for any operator who opens the exporter in a browser for the first time.

## Process Classification

Every process in `/proc` is classified into a `(group, subgroup)` pair by matching its executable name against
`data/subgroups.toml`. The matching logic checks `matches` (process name prefixes against `/proc/<pid>/comm`) and
`cmdline_matches` (substrings against the full command line, useful for JVM processes where `comm` is always `java`).
A process matching no entry is assigned `{group="other", subgroup="unknown"}`.

### Built-in groups

| Group | Subgroups |
|---|---|
| backup | bacula, commvault, cohesity, netbackup, networker, rubrik, spectrum_protect, tsm, veeam |
| cache | memcached, redis, varnish |
| cicd | ansible, chef, gitlab, jenkins, openstack, puppet, saltstack, terraform |
| container | containerd, crio, docker, kubelet, podman |
| db | cassandra, clickhouse, cockroachdb, couchbase, couchdb, db2, influxdb, mongodb, mssql, mysql, oracle, percona, postgres, rethinkdb, timescaledb, yugabyte |
| erp | peoplesoft, sap |
| logging | elasticsearch, filebeat, fluentd, graylog, kibana, log_collectors, logstash, splunk |
| messaging | activemq, kafka, nats, nsq, pulsar, rabbitmq, zeromq |
| monitoring | alertmanager, blackbox, grafana, icinga_nagios, node_exporter, percona, prometheus, snmp, telegraf, thanos, victoriametrics, zabbix |
| network | bind, dhcp, haproxy, keepalived, lvs, ntp, proxy_squid, vpn |
| runtime | go, java, nodejs, php, python, ruby |
| security | audit_tools, freeipa, kerberos_client, keycloak, ldap_client, osquery, selinux_apparmor, snort, sssd, suricata, vault, wazuh, zeek |
| storage | ceph, drbd, gluster, iscsi, lustre, minio, nfs, samba |
| system | audit, cron, firewall, kernel, postfix, rsyslog, sendmail, ssh, systemd |
| virtualization | libvirt, qemu, vbox |
| web | apache, caddy, glassfish, jetty, nginx, springboot, tomcat, weblogic, websphere |
| other | unknown (fallback for all unclassified processes) |

### Custom subgroups

Add entries to `data/subgroups.toml` without modifying source code:

```toml
subgroups = [
  { group = "db", subgroup = "mysql", matches = [
    "mysqld",
    "mariadbd",
  ] },
  { group = "web", subgroup = "tomcat", matches = [
    "tomcat",
  ], cmdline_matches = [
    "org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap",
    "catalina.sh",
  ] },
]
```

`cmdline_matches` is the right tool for JVM-based services where `/proc/<pid>/comm` is always `java` — match on the
main class or startup script instead.

File search order: `./subgroups.toml` → `/etc/herakles/subgroups.toml`.

List loaded subgroups at runtime:

```bash
herakles-node-exporter subgroups
herakles-node-exporter subgroups --group db --verbose
```

## Installation

### Docker

The image expects a pre-built statically linked musl binary and runs as the `herakles` user (uid=1000). `--pid=host`
and a `/proc` bind-mount are required for full host monitoring.

```bash
docker build -t herakles-node-exporter:latest .

docker run -d \
  --name herakles-node-exporter \
  --pid=host \
  -v /proc:/proc:ro \
  -p 9215:9215 \
  herakles-node-exporter:latest
```

---

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from the first file found in this order, then merged with CLI flags (CLI takes precedence):

1. `--config <path>` if specified
2. `/etc/herakles/herakles-node-exporter.yaml` (also `.yml`, `.json`)
3. `./herakles-node-exporter.yaml` (also `.yml`, `.json`)

Use `--no-config` to ignore all config files. Use `--show-config` to print the effective merged configuration.

### Graceful degradation

eBPF initialization failure is non-fatal. If `EbpfManager::new()` returns an error, the exporter logs a warning and
continues. All non-eBPF metrics remain fully functional. Check `/health` to see whether eBPF initialized successfully.

```
INFO  ✅ eBPF programs loaded and attached successfully
WARN  ⚠️  Failed to initialize eBPF: [reason] - running without eBPF metrics
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# BTF availability
ls -la /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux

# Kernel version
uname -r

# Capabilities
capsh --print | grep -E 'cap_bpf|cap_perfmon'

# Build tools
clang --version && llvm-strip --version

# Runtime requirement check
herakles-node-exporter check --all

# eBPF status at runtime
curl http://localhost:9215/health
```

## Example PromQL Queries

```promql
# RSS memory for all postgres processes across all hosts
herakles_group_memory_rss_bytes{subgroup="postgres"}

# PSS memory by group — deduplicates shared memory contributions
herakles_group_memory_pss_bytes{group="db"}

# Disk read throughput per group (bytes/sec)
rate(herakles_group_blkio_read_bytes[5m])

# Disk write throughput per block device
rate(herakles_system_disk_write_bytes[5m])

# Filesystem usage per mountpoint (0.0–1.0)
1 - (herakles_system_filesystem_avail_bytes / herakles_system_filesystem_size_bytes)

# Filesystems below 10% free space
(herakles_system_filesystem_avail_bytes / herakles_system_filesystem_size_bytes) < 0.1

# Network receive throughput per interface
rate(herakles_system_net_rx_bytes[5m])

# Network transmit throughput per process group (requires eBPF)
rate(herakles_group_net_tx_bytes[5m])

# CPU pressure stall rate — fraction of time stalled on CPU
rate(herakles_system_cpu_psi_wait_seconds[5m])

# Memory pressure stall rate
rate(herakles_system_memory_psi_wait_seconds[5m])

# I/O pressure stall rate
rate(herakles_system_disk_psi_wait_seconds[5m])

# Alert: system memory pressure above 90%
herakles_system_memory_used_ratio > 0.9

# Alert: db group memory growing faster than 100MB/min
rate(herakles_group_memory_rss_bytes{group="db"}[5m]) * 60 > 1e8
